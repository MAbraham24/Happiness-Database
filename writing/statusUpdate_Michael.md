#### Progress

- Steps I /we have taken already:

```
Currently I have helped my team in choosing a topic and outlining what database systems we will use for the development. My team has imported the data into the file and has created build functions and python functions for running/interacting with the database.
```

- Steps that I /we will take:

```
I will be in charge of writing documentation for the code, like the ReadMe files and updating the status report. Our team will also be helping in each other for things like querying the database and transferring the infomration to StreamLit. 
```

#### Code Sample

- What is the submitted code and how does it help to accomplish the research goals of this project?

```
The current submitted code is a Python program that can perform queries on an SQL database. It currently has a user interface in the terminal, but this is only a temporary implementation that will be replaced by Streamlit. This currently code is to exercise the logic of performing queries.
```
