#### Progress

- Steps I /we have taken already:

```
We currently have a builder file, the SQLite database, and Python code that can make SQL queries.
```

- Steps that I /we will take:

```
We still need to write the readme file, the report, and finished the Python file of the database manager. We intend on using Streamlit in the finished version of the code. We also still need to actually run the queries to answer our research questions.
```

#### Code Sample

- What is the submitted code and how does it help to accomplish the research goals of this project?

```
The current submitted code is a Python program that can perform queries on an SQL database. It currently has a user interface in the terminal, but this is only a temporary implementation that will be replaced by Streamlit. This currently code is to exercise the logic of performing queries.
```
