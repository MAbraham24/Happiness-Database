 ```
#### Five Intellectual Research Questions of Scholarship

 - Question 1

 ```
 What is the overall happiness rating change from 2015 to 2019?
 ```

 - Question 2

 ```
 Is trust in government going up over the years and is that correlated with freedom?
 ```

 - Question 3

 ```
 Does a certain attribute contribute the most to the happiness score?
 ```

 ```
What do countries with lower happiness scores have in common?
 ```

 - Question 5
 
 ```
What is the evident cause of change in happiness scores of specific countries over the years of recorded data?
 ```

#### Progress

- Steps I /we have taken already:

```
I created a draft builder file and the SQLite database that it currently generates. I call this a 'draft' because it is possible that we will chose to edit the schema moving forward. I have also created the current Python program. The current program is a bit of a prototype of what we plan to make. It currently houses the logic to perform SQL queries. At the moment, the user interface is in the terminal, but we do plan on replacing that with a Streamlit UI.
```

- Steps that I /we will take:

```
We still need to write the readme file, the report, and finish the Python file of the database manager. We intend on using Streamlit in the finished version of the code. We also still need to actually run the queries to answer our research questions.

I plan on contributing to the Streamlit implementation in the Python file and will likely document the code I have written in the readme. It is likely that answering the research questions and writing the report will be divided among each member.
```

#### Code Sample

- What is the submitted code and how does it help to accomplish the research goals of this project?

```
The current submitted code is a Python program that can perform queries on an SQL database. It currently has a user interface in the terminal, but this is only a temporary implementation that will be replaced by Streamlit. This currently code is to exercise the logic of performing queries.
```
